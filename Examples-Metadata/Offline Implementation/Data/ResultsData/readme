(1) Results from measuring offline the full field defined as shown in the picture (ROI_FF.png) are available in “AllPointEstHeights_2D_Final.png” and “AllPointEstHeights_3D_Final.png”. 

(2) The metadata file “Offline_ICM_20160723_184739_H130_W220_FF.mat” presents a full record of the analysis and results.

(3) The video “Sample040711_EI25_SignalResults_2016.avi” displays the measurement results for all the pixels in the ROI.

(4) Notes:
To implement this example, a physical system of the same setup as in the authors’ lab is NOT required. One could just import the video (Sample040711_EI25_ICM_Video_2016.avi) and “IMAQ_20160407_145132.mat” file in the sub-folder of “Data”, and specify the ROI as per the “ROI_FF.png” in the MATLAB code “pb_SetROI_Callback.m”, then run the software to measure the ROI’s pixel(s)’ cured heights. If interested, one can refer to the results in the folder “ResultsData”.

For detailed interpretation of the results in the folder "ResultsData", please refer to the following publications. This example is referred as "Validation Group #2 Experiment #4" in Chapter 8 and Appendix A in the reference dissertation [1]. The corresponding results are also reported in a journal paper [2].
