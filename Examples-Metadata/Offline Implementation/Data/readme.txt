The analyzed video was acquired in a real time experiment of the ECPL process. This offline implementation utilizes the real-time acquired video (Sample040711_EI25_ICM_Video_2016.avi) and real-time logged metadata (IMAQ_20160407_145132.mat) are in the folder "LabData". 

For detailed interpretation of the results in the folder "ResultsData", please refer to the following publications. This example is referred as "Validation Group #2 Experiment #4" in Chapter 8 and Appendix A in the reference disseratation (1). The corresponding results are also reported in a journal paper(2).
