Two demo videos show how to use the software to analyze off line the interferometric video and associated data for measuring the photocuring process in terms of cured thickness. Please note that two different samples are used in the videos, respectively. A smaller curing part experiment is used to demonstrate the software’s capability of measuring multiple pixels in a full field.

The demo video “OfflineICMM_SinglePixel_Microscope_Sample040711.mp4” shows single pixel measurement off line. Its download link is: https://www.dropbox.com/s/9djkrn7c7r1ungd/OfflineICMM_SinglePixel_Microscope_Sample040711.mp4?dl=0

The demo video “OfflineICMM_FF_AllProcess_Sample040511.mp4” shows multiple pixel measurement off line. Its download link is: https://www.dropbox.com/s/xcjckph0f4ojkl4/OfflineICMM_FF_AllProcess_Sample040511.mp4?dl=0

Please note that the corresponding experiment design and results are detailed in the authors’ dissertation Chapter 8 [Reference 1].
