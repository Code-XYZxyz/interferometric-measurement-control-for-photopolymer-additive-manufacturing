In the experiment, only one pixel (Height: 225; Width 285) in the sample was monitored online due to limited computation resource. The real-time monitored signal of the pixel’s grayscale is as shown in the plot “Group1S06_RT_Grayscale_Px_225_285.png”. The real-time measurement results are presented in “AllPointEstHeights_mean.png” and “AllPointEstHeights_zExposed_mean.png”.
