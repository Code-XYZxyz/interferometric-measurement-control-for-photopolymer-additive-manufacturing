Two examples are provided in this session to instruct users how to use the software for, respectively, (1) offline measurement of a cured part [Reference 1] with an existing ICM&M video file and (2) real-time measurement feedback control of a cured part during the photopolymerization process given a physical system available [Reference 2]. 
More details about the experiment examples and results interpretation are also available in the referred dissertation [Reference 3].
