# interferometric-measurement-control-for-photopolymer-additive-manufacturing
This is a comprehensive MATLAB-based software platform developed for real-time measurement and control of a custom mask-projection photopolymerization based additive manufacturing system (referred as "ECPL") using a lab-built interferometry (referred as "ICM&M"). A graphical user interface using the graphical user interface development environment (GUIDE) of MATLAB was created to implement the ICM&M method for the ECPL process. The software interfaces with the hardware of the ECPL system’s ultraviolet lamp and DMD, and the ICM&M system’s camera. It was designed to streamline the operation of the ECPL process with the aid of parallel computing that implements online both the ICM&M acquisition and measurement analysis as well as the feedback control method. The application logs the acquired interferogram video data, performs numerical computations for the ICM&M measurement algorithms and control law, saves the real-time data and measurement results for all voxels in the region of interest. Meanwhile, it displays interferogram frames and visualize the photocuring process without a substantial sacrifice in temporal performance of other key functions such as data acquisition and measurement & control analysis. The software could be extended to real-time process measurement and control for other additive manufacturing systems, for example, metal based additive manufacturing aided by in-situ thermal images analysis.
